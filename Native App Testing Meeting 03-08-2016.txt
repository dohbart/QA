Native App Testing Meeting 03-08-2016

Best to test with client issued devices (ABI iPads for example)
Casey (or a designated Producer) would gather devices
(Libby is a Producer & Julie has some producers too)

Use Test Flight to install apps on Browserstack

X-Code can report on App performance stats - memory, processor utilization, etc.
Right now, we're keeping X-Code in the dev wheelhouse so QA doesn't need to test


Note: I looked up Test Flight, and it appears to be down.  I found TestFairy as a replacement.
